# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

### Project Overview

As a newly hired Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm, my role is to analyze data to anticipate future skill requirements. To stay competitive in the evolving tech landscape, the organization regularly examines industry trends to identify the most in-demand programming skills.

In this project, I collect data from multiple sources, including job postings, training portals, and surveys, to determine key programming skills in demand. Using data from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, I conduct a comprehensive analysis to uncover insights and trends.
Each phase of the data analysis process is documented in separate notebooks within this repository, along with additional reference files for context.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, covering everything from developersâ€™ favorite technologies to their job preferences.
