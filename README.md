# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this project, we’ll assume we’ve just been hired as a data analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm renowned for its expertise in IT solutions and a team of highly experienced consultants. 
To stay current with evolving technologies and remain competitive, the organization regularly analyzes data to anticipate future skill requirements.

As Data Analysts, our role is to gather data from various sources and identify trends for this year’s report on emerging skills. Our first objective is to collect the most in-demand programming skills from multiple channels such as job postings, training portals, and surveys.

Once we’ve amassed sufficient data, we’ll begin our analysis to uncover insights and trends. Each phase of the data analysis process is detailed in its notebook within this repository, along with additional files for context and reference.
