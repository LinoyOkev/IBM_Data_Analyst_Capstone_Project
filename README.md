# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

### Project Overview

For this project, I will assume the role of an Associate Data Analyst at a technology consulting organization. My primary task is to analyze the data and obtain valuable insights into current and future technological trends using the latest Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. 

In this project, I will analyze data to answer key questions about the use of technology. I will analyze trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks, focusing on those technologies professionals currently use and those they aim to learn in the future. Through careful analysis, I will extract insights highlighting emerging patterns and shifts in the tech landscape. These findings will then be presented to various stakeholders in my organization for informed decision-making.

### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, covering everything from developers’ favorite technologies to their job preferences.

### Tools and software
- SQL
- Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- IBM Cognos

### Objectives

- Exploring the Dataset
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

### [Exploring the Dataset](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/1.Explore%20Data%20Set.ipynb)

In the initial phase of data analysis, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data formatting

### [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/4.Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

We will perform data wrangling which involves transforming and preparing raw data into a structured and usable format for analysis. It involves various techniques to clean, normalize, and integrate data from different sources.
- Removing inconsistencies
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling missing values
- Applying feature scaling.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/5.a.Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

EDA involved exploring the following key questions: 
- What factors influence job satisfaction and remote work trends?
- How does programming language usage vary by region?
- What is the relationship between experience and job satisfaction?
- How does educational background relate to employment type?

These questions guide the analysis by focusing on workplace trends, programming skills, and job satisfaction metrics.

### [Data Visualization](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/6.Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

In this step, we focus on data visualization using data extracted from an RDBMS via SQL queries. The key objectives include:
- Understanding data distribution to identify patterns and outliers.
- Exploring relationships between features through visual analysis.
- Comparing and composing data using charts and graphs for better insights.
