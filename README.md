# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

### Project Overview

As a newly hired Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm, my role is to analyze data to anticipate future skill requirements. To stay competitive in the evolving tech landscape, the organization regularly examines industry trends to identify the most in-demand programming skills.

In this project, I collect data from multiple sources, including job postings, training portals, and surveys, to determine key programming skills in demand. Using data from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, I conduct a comprehensive analysis to uncover insights and trends.
Each phase of the data analysis process is documented in separate notebooks within this repository, along with additional reference files for context.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, covering everything from developersâ€™ favorite technologies to their job preferences.

### Objectives

- Exploring the Dataset
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

### [Exploring the Dataset](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/1.Explore%20Data%20Set.ipynb)

In the initial phase of data analysis, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data formatting

### [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/4.Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

We will perform data wrangling which involves transforming and preparing raw data into a structured and usable format for analysis. It involves various techniques to clean, normalize, and integrate data from different sources.
- Removing inconsistencies
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling missing values
- Applying feature scaling.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/5.a.Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

EDA involved exploring the following key questions: 
- What factors influence job satisfaction and remote work trends?
- How does programming language usage vary by region?
- What is the relationship between experience and job satisfaction?
- How does educational background relate to employment type?

These questions guide the analysis by focusing on workplace trends, programming skills, and job satisfaction metrics.

### [Data Visualization](https://github.com/LinoyOkev/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/6.Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

In this step, we focus on data visualization using data extracted from an RDBMS via SQL queries. The key objectives include:
- Understanding data distribution to identify patterns and outliers.
- Exploring relationships between features through visual analysis.
- Comparing and composing data using charts and graphs for better insights.
